# SpektirProject
A compilation of my work from my internship with Nuromedia during summer 2023. I was assigned to create an object detection model to create and learn from simulated gas leak data.

## Blender
The blender folder containes the DocekrFile and nessicary setup and python files to create render images of what a gas leak would look like on a thermal imaging camera.
